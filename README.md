# Evaluating Cultural Centers in Austin, Texas

## Overview
Cultural centers, serving as venues for diverse groups to celebrate their heritage through activities and programs, hold significant
importance in communities across the United States. These centers are crucial for preserving traditions and educating young 
generations about their familyâ€™s culture. They also provide opportunities for individuals to explore cultures beyond their own,
enriching their understanding of the diverse cultural makeup of the United States. Ultimately, these centers enable individuals to 
honor their own cultural traditions and learn about the heritage of others in their community, fostering a more well-rounded society
where people appreciate their fellow community members. 

Recognizing the importance of cultural centers to their community, the city government of Austin, Texas, distributed a comprehensive
survey to more than a thousand community members in January 2020. This survey targeted four major cultural centers: the African
American Cultural and Heritage Facility (AACHF), the Asian American Resource Center (AARC), the Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American 
Cultural Center (ESB-MACC), and the George Washington Carver Museum (Carver Museum). Its aim was to evaluate operational aspects of
these centers to determine contributors to community satisfaction and identify areas needing improvement. The survey assessed 
facilities and staff at all four centers while also evaluating fees and programs at the AARC, Carver Museum, and the ESB-MACC.

The survey featured four qualitative, open-ended questions designed to gather detailed feedback on the facilities, staff, fees, and
programs at the cultural centers. It also included quantitative questions, such as those on a Likert scale, to evaluate various 
aspects of the centers. This research analyzed the responses to the open-ended questions using a range of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques, including term frequencies, term frequency-inverse document frequency, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
Additionally, the results from the quantitative questions were analyzed to enhance the findings from the NLP techniques.
